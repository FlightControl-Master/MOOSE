	- Expanded the CARGO classes and implemented the CARGO_GROUPED classes.
		-- Finished the correct state machine implementation to Board, UnBoard, Load, UnLoad cargo to and from carriers.
		-- Created the CARGO_GROUPED class, which groups CARGO_UNITs into one group. The cargo behaves like groups, but can be transported by carriers.
		-- Documented CARGO event functions, state transition functions + overall documentation.
		-- Updated test missions located in the directory: Moose_Test_CARGO

	- Expanded the PROCESS_PATROLZONE class.

2016-08-21

	- Made a new STATEMACHINE_CONTROLLABLE object, which models a base state machine class to be inherited by AI controllable classes.
		-- Created the class as such that intherited AI classes become "finite state machines".
		-- Each STATEMACHINE_CONTROLLABLE class contains a Controllable object, which is one Unit, Client or Group object.
		-- Added state transition functions that are called before and after the state transition.
		-- Event functions are automatically added to the class, based on the FSMT.
		-- Added immediate and delayed event processing as part of the STATEMACHINE_CONTROLLABLE class.
			--- Events that start with __Event are processed with a delay. The delay is given in seconds as a parameter.
	
	- Created a new PROCESS_PATROLZONE class, which inherites STATEMACHINE_CONTROLLABLE.
		-- This class implements a complete new revamped patrol zone AI pattern.
		-- Created a new test directory: Moose_Test_PROCESS_PATROLZONE with test missions.

	- Added InitRandomizeUnits() method, taking 3 parameters:
		-- RandomizeUnits given the value true, will randomize the units upon spawning, false (default) will not randomize the untis.
		-- OuterRadius is the outer radius of the band where the units will be spawned, if RandomizeUnits is true.
		-- InnerRadius is the inner radius of the band where the units will not be spawned, if RandomizeUnits is true.
