-- 
-- # QUICK START GUIDE
-- 
-- The following class is available to model an AIR defense system.
-- 
-- AI_AIR_DISPATCHER is the main AIR defense class that models the AIR defense system.
-- 
-- Before you start using the AI_AIR_DISPATCHER, ask yourself the following questions.
-- 
-- 
-- ## 1. Which coalition am I modeling an AIR defense system for? blue or red?
-- 
-- One AI_AIR_DISPATCHER object can create a defense system for **one coalition**, which is blue or red.
-- If you want to create a **mutual defense system**, for both blue and red, then you need to create **two** AI_AIR_DISPATCHER **objects**,
-- each governing their defense system for one coalition.
-- 
--      
-- ## 2. Which type of detection will I setup? Grouping based per AREA, per TYPE or per UNIT? (Later others will follow).
-- 
-- The MOOSE framework leverages the @{Functional.Detection} classes to perform the reconnaissance, detecting enemy units 
-- and reporting them to the head quarters.
-- Several types of @{Functional.Detection} classes exist, and the most common characteristics of these classes is that they:
-- 
--    * Perform detections from multiple recce as one co-operating entity.
--    * Communicate with a @{Tasking.CommandCenter}, which consolidates each detection.
--    * Groups detections based on a method (per area, per type or per unit).
--    * Communicates detections.
-- 
-- 
-- ## 3. Which recce units can be used as part of the detection system? Only ground based, or also airborne?
-- 
-- Depending on the type of mission you want to achieve, different types of units can be engaged to perform ground enemy targets reconnaissance.
-- Ground recce (FAC) are very useful units to determine the position of enemy ground targets when they spread out over the battlefield at strategic positions.
-- Using their varying detection technology, and especially those ground units which have spotting technology, can be extremely effective at
-- detecting targets at great range. The terrain elevation characteristics are a big tool in making ground recce to be more effective.
-- Unfortunately, they lack sometimes the visibility to detect targets at greater range, or when scenery is preventing line of sight.
-- If you succeed to position recce at higher level terrain providing a broad and far overview of the lower terrain in the distance, then
-- the recce will be very effective at detecting approaching enemy targets. Therefore, always use the terrain very carefully!
-- 
-- Airborne recce (AFAC) are also very effective. The are capable of patrolling at a functional detection altitude,
-- having an overview of the whole battlefield. However, airborne recce can be vulnerable to air to ground attacks, 
-- so you need air superiority to make them effective. 
-- Airborne recce will also have varying ground detection technology, which plays a big role in the effectiveness of the reconnaissance.
-- Certain helicopter or plane types have ground searching radars or advanced ground scanning technology, and are very effective 
-- compared to air units having only visual detection capabilities.
-- For example, for the red coalition, the Mi-28N and the Su-34; and for the blue side, the reaper, are such effective airborne recce units.
-- 
-- Typically, don't want these recce units to engage with the enemy, you want to keep them at position. Therefore, it is a good practice
-- to set the ROE for these recce to hold weapons, and make them invisible from the enemy.
-- 
-- It is not possible to perform a recce function as a player (unit).
-- 
-- 
-- ## 4. How do the defenses decide **when and where to engage** on approaching enemy units?
-- 
-- The AIR dispacher needs you to setup (various) defense coordinates, which are strategic positions in the battle field to be defended. 
-- Any ground based enemy approaching within the proximity of such a defense point, may trigger for a defensive action by friendly air units.
-- 
-- There are 2 important parameters that play a role in the defensive decision making: defensiveness and reactivity.
-- 
-- The AIR dispatcher provides various parameters to setup the **defensiveness**, 
-- which models the decision **when** a defender will engage with the approaching enemy.
-- Defensiveness is calculated by a probability distribution model when to trigger a defense action, 
-- depending on the distance of the enemy unit from the defense coordinates, and a **defensiveness factor**. 
-- 
-- The other parameter considered for defensive action is **where the enemy is located**, thus the distance from a defense coordinate, 
-- which we call the **reactive distance**. By default, the reactive distance is set to 60km, but can be changed by the mission designer
-- using the available method explained further below.
-- The combination of the defensiveness and reactivity results in a model that, the closer the attacker is to the defense point, 
-- the higher the probability will be that a defense action will be launched!
-- 
-- 
-- ## 5. Are defense coordinates and defense reactivity the only parameters?
-- 
-- No, depending on the target type, and the threat level of the target, the probability of defense will be higher.
-- In other words, when a SAM-10 radar emitter is detected, its probabilty for defense will be much higher than when a BMP-1 vehicle is
-- detected, even when both enemies are at the same distance from a defense coordinate.
-- This will ensure optimal defenses, SEAD tasks will be launched much more quicker against engaging radar emitters, to ensure air superiority.
-- Approaching main battle tanks will be engaged much faster, than a group of approaching trucks.
-- 
-- 
-- ## 6. Which Squadrons will I create and which name will I give each Squadron?
-- 
-- The AIR defense system works with **Squadrons**. Each Squadron must be given a unique name, that forms the **key** to the squadron.
-- Several options and activities can be set per Squadron. A free format name can be given, but always ensure that the name is meaningfull 
-- for your mission, and remember that squadron names are used for communication to the players of your mission.
-- 
-- There are mainly 3 types of defenses: **SEAD**, **CAS** and **BAI**.
-- 
-- Suppression of Air Defenses (SEAD) are effective agains radar emitters. Close Air Support (CAS) is launched when the enemy is close near friendly units.
-- Battleground Air Interdiction (BAI) tasks are launched when there are no friendlies around.
-- 
-- Depending on the defense type, different payloads will be needed. See further points on squadron definition.
-- 
-- 
-- ## 7. Where will the Squadrons be located? On Airbases? On Carrier Ships? On FARPs?
-- 
-- Squadrons are placed at the **home base** on an **airfield**, **carrier** or **farp**.
-- Carefully plan where each Squadron will be located as part of the defense system required for mission effective defenses.
-- If the home base of the squadron is too far from assumed enemy positions, then the defenses will be too late.
-- The home bases must be **behind** enemy lines, you want to prevent your home bases to be engaged by enemies!
-- Depending on the units applied for defenses, the home base can be further or closer to the enemies.
-- Any airbase, farp or carrier can act as the launching platform for AIR defenses.
-- Carefully plan which airbases will take part in the coalition. Color each airbase **in the color of the coalition**, using the mission editor,
-- or your air units will not return for landing at the airbase!
-- 
-- 
-- ## 8. Which helicopter or plane models will I assign for each Squadron? Do I need one plane model or more plane models per squadron?
-- 
-- Per Squadron, one or multiple helicopter or plane models can be allocated as **Templates**.
-- These are late activated groups with one airplane or helicopter that start with a specific name, called the **template prefix**.
-- The AIR defense system will select from the given templates a random template to spawn a new plane (group).
-- 
-- A squadron will perform specific task types (SEAD, CAS or BAI). So, squadrons will require specific templates for the
-- task types it will perform. A squadron executing SEAD defenses, will require a payload with long range anti-radar seeking missiles.
--  
--  
-- ## 9. Which payloads, skills and skins will these plane models have?
-- 
-- Per Squadron, even if you have one plane model, you can still allocate multiple templates of one plane model, 
-- each having different payloads, skills and skins. 
-- The AIR defense system will select from the given templates a random template to spawn a new plane (group).
-- 
-- 
-- ## 10. How to squadrons engage in a defensive action?
-- 
-- There are two ways how squadrons engage and execute your AIR defenses. 
-- Squadrons can start the defense directly from the airbase, farp or carrier. When a squadron launches a defensive group, that group
-- will start directly from the airbase. The other way is to launch early on in the mission a patrolling mechanism.
-- Squadrons will launch air units to patrol in specific zone(s), so that when ground enemy targets are detected, that the airborne
-- AIR defenses can come immediately into action.
-- 
-- 
-- ## 11. For each Squadron doing a patrol, which zone types will I create?
-- 
-- Per zone, evaluate whether you want:
-- 
--    * simple trigger zones
--    * polygon zones
--    * moving zones
-- 
-- Depending on the type of zone selected, a different @{Zone} object needs to be created from a ZONE_ class.
-- 
-- 
-- ## 12. Are moving defense coordinates possible?
-- 
-- Yes, different COORDINATE types are possible to be used.
-- The COORDINATE_UNIT will help you to specify a defense coodinate that is attached to a moving unit.
-- 
-- 
-- ## 13. How much defense coordinates do I need to create?
-- 
-- It depends, but the idea is to define only the necessary defense points that drive your mission.
-- If you define too much defense points, the performance of your mission may decrease. Per defense point defined,
-- all the possible enemies are evaluated. Note that each defense coordinate has a reach depending on the size of the defense radius.
-- The default defense radius is about 60km, and depending on the defense reactivity, defenses will be launched when the enemy is at
-- close or greater distance from the defense coordinate.
-- 
-- 
-- ## 14. For each Squadron doing patrols, what are the time intervals and patrol amounts to be performed?
-- 
-- For each patrol:
-- 
--    * **How many** patrol you want to have airborne at the same time?
--    * **How frequent** you want the defense mechanism to check whether to start a new patrol?
-- 
-- other considerations:   
-- 
--    * **How far** is the patrol area from the engagement "hot zone". You want to ensure that the enemy is reached on time!
--    * **How safe** is the patrol area taking into account air superiority. Is it well defended, are there nearby A2A bases?
-- 
-- 
-- ## 15. For each Squadron, which takeoff method will I use?
-- 
-- For each Squadron, evaluate which takeoff method will be used:
-- 
--    * Straight from the air
--    * From the runway
--    * From a parking spot with running engines
--    * From a parking spot with cold engines
-- 
-- **The default takeoff method is staight in the air.**
-- This takeoff method is the most useful if you want to avoid airplane clutter at airbases!
-- But it is the least realistic one!
-- 
-- 
-- ## 16. For each Squadron, which landing method will I use?
-- 
-- For each Squadron, evaluate which landing method will be used:
-- 
--    * Despawn near the airbase when returning
--    * Despawn after landing on the runway
--    * Despawn after engine shutdown after landing
--    
-- **The default landing method is despawn when near the airbase when returning.**
-- This landing method is the most useful if you want to avoid airplane clutter at airbases!
-- But it is the least realistic one!
-- 
-- 
-- ## 19. For each Squadron, which **defense overhead** will I use?
-- 
-- For each Squadron, depending on the helicopter or airplane type (modern, old) and payload, which overhead is required to provide any defense?
-- 
-- In other words, if **X** enemy ground units are detected, how many **Y** defense helicpters or airplanes need to engage (per squadron)?
-- The **Y** is dependent on the type of airplane (era), payload, fuel levels, skills etc.
-- But the most important factor is the payload, which is the amount of AIR weapons the defense can carry to attack the enemy ground units.
-- For example, a Ka-50 can carry 16 vikrs, that means, that it potentially can destroy at least 8 ground units without a reload of ammunication.
-- That means, that one defender can destroy more enemy ground units. 
-- Thus, the overhead is a **factor** that will calculate dynamically how many **Y** defenses will be required based on **X** attackers detected.
-- 
-- **The default overhead is 1. A smaller value than 1, like 0.25 will decrease the overhead to a 1 / 4 ratio, meaning, 
-- one defender for each 4 detected ground enemy units. **
-- 
-- 
-- ## 19. For each Squadron, which grouping will I use?
-- 
-- When multiple targets are detected, how will defenses be grouped when multiple defense air units are spawned for multiple enemy ground units?
-- Per one, two, three, four?
-- 
-- **The default grouping is 1. That means, that each spawned defender will act individually.**
-- But you can specify a number between 1 and 4, so that the defenders will act as a group.

  --- AI_AIR_DISPATCHER class.
  -- @type AI_AIR_DISPATCHER
  -- @extends Tasking.DetectionManager#DETECTION_MANAGER

  --- Create an automated AIR defense system based on a detection network of reconnaissance vehicles and air units, coordinating SEAD, BAI and CAP operations.
  -- 
  -- ===
  -- 
  -- When your mission is in the need to take control of the AI to automate and setup a process of air to ground defenses, this is the module you need.
  -- The defense system work through the definition of defense coordinates, which are points in your friendly area within the battle field, that your mission need to have defended.
  -- Multiple defense coordinates can be setup. Defense coordinates can be strategic or tactical positions or references to strategic units or scenery.
  -- The AIR dispatcher will evaluate every x seconds the tactical situation around each defense coordinate. When a defense coordinate
  -- is under threat, it will communicate through the command center that defensive actions need to be taken and will launch groups of air units for defense.
  -- The level of threat to the defense coordinate varyies upon the strength and types of the enemy units, the distance to the defense point, and the defensiveness parameters.
  -- Defensive actions are taken through probability, but the closer and the more threat the enemy poses to the defense coordinate, the faster it will be attacked by friendly AIR units.
  -- 
  -- Please study carefully the underlying explanations how to setup and use this module, as it has many features.
  -- It also requires a little study to ensure that you get a good understanding of the defense mechanisms, to ensure a strong
  -- defense for your missions.

  -- # USAGE GUIDE
  -- 
  -- ## 1. AI\_AIR\_DISPATCHER constructor:
  -- 
  -- ![Banner Image](..\Presentations\AI_AIR_DISPATCHER\AI_AIR_DISPATCHER-ME_1.JPG)
  -- 
  -- 
  -- The @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.New}() method creates a new AI_AIR_DISPATCHER instance.
  -- 
  -- ### 1.1. Define the **reconnaissance network**:
  -- 
  -- As part of the AI_AIR_DISPATCHER :New() constructor, a reconnaissance network must be given as the first parameter.
  -- A reconnaissance network is provided by passing a @{Functional.Detection} object.
  -- The most effective reconnaissance for the AIR dispatcher would be to use the @{Functional.Detection#DETECTION_AREAS} object.
  -- 
  -- A reconnaissance network, is used to detect enemy ground targets, 
  -- potentially group them into areas, and to understand the position, level of threat of the enemy.
  -- 
  -- ![Banner Image](..\Presentations\AI_AIR_DISPATCHER\Dia5.JPG)
  -- 
  -- As explained in the introduction, depending on the type of mission you want to achieve, different types of units can be applied to detect ground enemy targets.
  -- Ground based units are very useful to act as a reconnaissance, but they lack sometimes the visibility to detect targets at greater range.
  -- Recce are very useful to acquire the position of enemy ground targets when spread out over the battlefield at strategic positions.
  -- Ground units also have varying detectors, and especially the ground units which have laser guiding missiles can be extremely effective at
  -- detecting targets at great range. The terrain elevation characteristics are a big tool in making ground recce to be more effective.
  -- If you succeed to position recce at higher level terrain providing a broad and far overview of the lower terrain in the distance, then
  -- the recce will be very effective at detecting approaching enemy targets. Therefore, always use the terrain very carefully!
  -- 
  -- Beside ground level units to use for reconnaissance, air units are also very effective. The are capable of patrolling at great speed
  -- covering a large terrain. However, airborne recce can be vulnerable to air to ground attacks, and you need air superiority to make then
  -- effective. Also the instruments available at the air units play a big role in the effectiveness of the reconnaissance.
  -- Air units which have ground detection capabilities will be much more effective than air units with only visual detection capabilities.
  -- For the red coalition, the Mi-28N and for the blue side, the reaper are such effective reconnaissance airborne units.
  -- 
  -- Reconnaissance networks are **dynamically constructed**, that is, they form part of the @{Functional.Detection} instance that is given as the first parameter to the AIR dispatcher.
  -- By defining in a **smart way the names or name prefixes of the reconnaissance groups**, these groups will be **automatically added or removed** to or from the reconnaissance network, 
  -- when these groups are spawned in or destroyed during the ongoing battle. 
  -- By spawning in dynamically additional recce, you can ensure that there is sufficient reconnaissance coverage so the defense mechanism is continuously
  -- alerted of new enemy ground targets.
  -- 
  -- The following example defens a new reconnaissance network using a @{Functional.Detection#DETECTION_AREAS} object.
  -- 
  --        -- Define a SET_GROUP object that builds a collection of groups that define the recce network.
  --        -- Here we build the network with all the groups that have a name starting with CCCP Recce.
  --        DetectionSetGroup = SET_GROUP:New() -- Defene a set of group objects, caled DetectionSetGroup.
  --        
  --        DetectionSetGroup:FilterPrefixes( { "CCCP Recce" } ) -- The DetectionSetGroup will search for groups that start with the name "CCCP Recce".
  --        
  --        -- This command will start the dynamic filtering, so when groups spawn in or are destroyed, 
  --        -- which have a group name starting with "CCCP Recce", then these will be automatically added or removed from the set.
  --        DetectionSetGroup:FilterStart() 
  --        
  --        -- This command defines the reconnaissance network.
  --        -- It will group any detected ground enemy targets within a radius of 1km.
  --        -- It uses the DetectionSetGroup, which defines the set of reconnaissance groups to detect for enemy ground targets.
  --        Detection = DETECTION_AREAS:New( DetectionSetGroup, 1000 )
  -- 
  --        -- Setup the A2A dispatcher, and initialize it.
  --        AIRDispatcher = AI_AIR_DISPATCHER:New( Detection )
  --        
  --        
  -- The above example creates a SET_GROUP instance, and stores this in the variable (object) **DetectionSetGroup**.
  -- **DetectionSetGroup** is then being configured to filter all active groups with a group name starting with `"CCCP Recce"` to be included in the set.
  -- **DetectionSetGroup** is then calling `FilterStart()`, which is starting the dynamic filtering or inclusion of these groups. 
  -- Note that any destroy or new spawn of a group having a name, starting with the above prefix, will be removed or added to the set.
  -- 
  -- Then a new detection object is created from the class `DETECTION_AREAS`. A grouping radius of 1000 meters (1km) is chosen.
  -- 
  -- The `Detection` object is then passed to the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.New}() method to indicate the reconnaissance network 
  -- configuration and setup the AIR defense detection mechanism.
  -- 
  -- ### 1.2. Setup the AIR dispatcher for both a red and blue coalition.
  -- 
  -- Following the above described procedure, you'll need to create for each coalition an separate detection network, and a separate AIR dispatcher.
  -- Ensure that while doing so, that you name the objects differently both for red and blue coalition.
  -- 
  -- For example like this for the red coalition:
  -- 
  --        DetectionRed = DETECTION_AREAS:New( DetectionSetGroupRed, 1000 )
  --        AIRDispatcherRed = AI_AIR_DISPATCHER:New( DetectionRed )
  --        
  -- And for the blue coalition:
  -- 
  --        DetectionBlue = DETECTION_AREAS:New( DetectionSetGroupBlue, 1000 )
  --        AIRDispatcherBlue = AI_AIR_DISPATCHER:New( DetectionBlue )
  -- 
  -- 
  -- Note: Also the SET_GROUP objects should be created for each coalition separately, containing each red and blue recce respectively!
  -- 
  -- ### 1.3. Define the enemy ground target **grouping radius**, in case you use DETECTION_AREAS:
  -- 
  -- The target grouping radius is a property of the DETECTION_AREAS class, that was passed to the AI_AIR_DISPATCHER:New() method, 
  -- but can be changed. The grouping radius should not be too small, but also depends on the types of ground forces and the way you want your mission to evolve.
  -- A large radius will mean large groups of enemy ground targets, while making smaller groups will result in a more fragmented defense system.
  -- Typically I suggest a grouping radius of 1km. This is the right balance to create efficient defenses.
  -- 
  -- Note that detected targets are constantly re-grouped, that is, when certain detected enemy ground units are moving further than the group radius, 
  -- then these units will become a separate area being detected. This may result in additional defenses being started by the dispatcher! 
  -- So don't make this value too small! Again, I advise about 1km or 1000 meters.
  -- 
  -- ## 2. Setup (a) **Defense Coordinate(s)**.
  -- 
  -- As explained above, defense coordinates are the center of your defense operations.
  -- The more threat to the defense coordinate, the higher it is likely a defensive action will be launched.
  -- 
  -- Find below an example how to add defense coordinates:
  -- 
  --        -- Add defense coordinates.
  --        AIRDispatcher:AddDefenseCoordinate( "HQ", GROUP:FindByName( "HQ" ):GetCoordinate() )
  -- 
  -- In this example, the coordinate of a group called `"HQ"` is retrieved, using `:GetCoordinate()`
  -- This returns a COORDINATE object, pointing to the first unit within the GROUP object.
  -- 
  -- The method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.AddDefenseCoordinate}() adds a new defense coordinate to the `AIRDispatcher` object.
  -- The first parameter is the key of the defense coordinate, the second the coordinate itself.
  -- 
  -- Later, a COORDINATE_UNIT will be added to the framework, which can be used to assign "moving" coordinates to an AIR dispatcher.
  -- 
  -- **REMEMBER!** 
  -- 
  --   - **Defense coordinates are the center of the AIR dispatcher defense system!**
  --   - **You can define more defense coordinates to defend a larger area.**
  --   - **Detected enemy ground targets are not immediately engaged, but are engaged with a reactivity or probability calculation!**
  -- 
  -- But, there is more to it ...
  -- 
  -- 
  -- ### 2.1. The **Defense Radius**.
  -- 
  -- The defense radius defines the maximum radius that a defense will be initiated around each defense coordinate.
  -- So even when there are targets further away than the defense radius, then these targets won't be engaged upon.
  -- By default, the defense radius is set to 100km (100.000 meters), but can be changed using the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefenseRadius}() method.
  -- Note that the defense radius influences the defense reactivity also! The larger the defense radius, the more reactive the defenses will be.
  -- 
  -- For example:
  -- 
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetDefenseRadius( 30000 )
  -- 
  -- This defines an AIR dispatcher which will engage on enemy ground targets within 30km radius around the defense coordinate.
  -- Note that the defense radius **applies to all defense coordinates** defined within the AIR dispatcher.
  -- 
  -- ### 2.2. The **Defense Reactivity**.
  -- 
  -- There are 5 levels that can be configured to tweak the defense reactivity. As explained above, the threat to a defense coordinate is 
  -- also determined by the distance of the enemy ground target to the defense coordinate.
  -- If you want to have a **low** defense reactivity, that is, the probability that an AIR defense will engage to the enemy ground target, then
  -- use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefenseReactivityLow}() method. For medium and high reactivity, use the methods 
  -- @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefenseReactivityMedium}() and @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefenseReactivityHigh}() respectively.
  -- 
  -- Note that the reactivity of defenses is always in relation to the Defense Radius! the shorter the distance, 
  -- the less reactive the defenses will be in terms of distance to enemy ground targets!
  -- 
  -- For example:
  -- 
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetDefenseReactivityHigh()
  --        
  -- This defines an AIR dispatcher with high defense reactivity.
  -- 
  -- ## 3. **Squadrons**.
  -- 
  -- The AIR dispatcher works with **Squadrons**, that need to be defined using the different methods available.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadron}() to **setup a new squadron** active at an airfield, farp or carrier, 
  -- while defining which helicopter or plane **templates** are being used by the squadron and how many **resources** are available.
  -- 
  -- **Multiple squadrons** can be defined within one AIR dispatcher, each having specific defense tasks and defense parameter settings!
  -- 
  -- Squadrons:
  -- 
  --   * Have name (string) that is the identifier or **key** of the squadron.
  --   * Have specific helicopter or plane **templates**.
  --   * Are located at **one** airbase, farp or carrier.
  --   * Optionally have a **limited set of resources**. The default is that squadrons have **unlimited resources**.
  -- 
  -- The name of the squadron given acts as the **squadron key** in all `AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron...()` or `AIRDispatcher:GetSquadron...()` methods.
  -- 
  -- Additionally, squadrons have specific configuration options to:
  -- 
  --   * Control how new helicopters or aircraft are taking off from the airfield, farp or carrier (in the air, cold, hot, at the runway).
  --   * Control how returning helicopters or aircraft are landing at the airfield, farp or carrier (in the air near the airbase, after landing, after engine shutdown).
  --   * Control the **grouping** of new helicopters or aircraft spawned at the airfield, farp or carrier. If there is more than one helicopter or aircraft to be spawned, these may be grouped.
  --   * Control the **overhead** or defensive strength of the squadron. Depending on the types of helicopters, planes, amount of resources and payload (weapon configuration) chosen, 
  --     the mission designer can choose to increase or reduce the amount of planes spawned.
  -- 
  -- The method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadron}() defines for you a new squadron. 
  -- The provided parameters are the squadron name, airbase name and a list of template prefixe, and a number that indicates the amount of resources.
  -- 
  -- For example, this defines 3 new squadrons:
  -- 
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop SEAD", AIRBASE.Caucasus.Maykop_Khanskaya, { "CCCP KA-50" }, 10 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop CAS", "CAS", { "CCCP KA-50" }, 10 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop BAI", "BAI", { "CCCP KA-50" }, 10 )
  -- 
  -- The latter 2 will depart from FARPs, which bare the name `"CAS"` and `"BAI"`.
  -- 
  -- 
  -- ### 3.1. Squadrons **Tasking**.
  -- 
  -- Squadrons can be commanded to execute 3 types of tasks, as explained above:
  -- 
  --   - SEAD: Suppression of Air Defenses, which are ground targets that have medium or long range radar emitters.
  --   - CAS : Close Air Support, when there are enemy ground targets close to friendly units.
  --   - BAI : Battlefield Air Interdiction, which are targets further away from the frond-line.
  -- 
  -- You need to configure each squadron which task types you want it to perform. Read on ...
  -- 
  -- ### 3.2. Squadrons enemy ground target **engagement types**.
  --   
  -- There are two ways how targets can be engaged: directly **on call** from the airfield, farp or carrier, or through a **patrol**.
  -- 
  -- Patrols are extremely handy, as these will airborne your helicopters or airplanes in advance. They will patrol in defined zones outlined, 
  -- and will engage with the targets once commanded. If the patrol zone is close enough to the enemy ground targets, then the time required
  -- to engage is heavily minimized!
  -- 
  -- However; patrols come with a side effect: since your resources are airborne, they will be vulnerable to incoming air attacks from the enemy.
  -- 
  -- The mission designer needs to carefully balance the need for patrols or the need for engagement on call from the airfields.
  -- 
  -- ### 3.3. Squadron **on call** engagement.
  -- 
  -- So to make squadrons engage targets from the airfields, use the following methods:
  -- 
  --   - For SEAD, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronSead}() method.
  --   - For CAS, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronCas}() method.
  --   - For BAI, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronBai}() method.
  -- 
  -- Note that for the tasks, specific helicopter or airplane templates are required to be used, which you can configure using your mission editor.
  -- Especially the payload (weapons configuration) is important to get right.
  -- 
  -- For example, the following will define for the squadrons different tasks:
  -- 
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop SEAD", AIRBASE.Caucasus.Maykop_Khanskaya, { "CCCP KA-50 SEAD" }, 10 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronSead( "Maykop SEAD", 120, 250 )
  --        
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop CAS", "CAS", { "CCCP KA-50 CAS" }, 10 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronCas( "Maykop CAS", 120, 250 )
  --        
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop BAI", "BAI", { "CCCP KA-50 BAI" }, 10 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronBai( "Maykop BAI", 120, 250 )
  -- 
  -- ### 3.4. Squadron **on patrol engagement**.
  -- 
  -- Squadrons can be setup to patrol in the air near the engagement hot zone.
  -- When needed, the AIR defense units will be close to the battle area, and can engage quickly.
  -- 
  -- So to make squadrons engage targets from a patrol zone, use the following methods:
  -- 
  --   - For SEAD, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronSeadPatrol}() method.
  --   - For CAS, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronCasPatrol}() method.
  --   - For BAI, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronBaiPatrol}() method.
  -- 
  -- Because a patrol requires more parameters, the following methods must be used to fine-tune the patrols for each squadron.
  -- 
  --   - For SEAD, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronSeadPatrolInterval}() method.
  --   - For CAS, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronCasPatrolInterval}() method.
  --   - For BAI, use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronBaiPatrolInterval}() method.
  -- 
  -- Here an example to setup patrols of various task types:
  -- 
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop SEAD", AIRBASE.Caucasus.Maykop_Khanskaya, { "CCCP KA-50 SEAD" }, 10 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronSeadPatrol( "Maykop SEAD", PatrolZone, 300, 500, 50, 80, 250, 300 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronPatrolInterval( "Maykop SEAD", 2, 30, 60, 1, "SEAD" )
  --        
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop CAS", "CAS", { "CCCP KA-50 CAS" }, 10 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronCasPatrol( "Maykop CAS", PatrolZone, 600, 700, 50, 80, 250, 300 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronPatrolInterval( "Maykop CAS", 2, 30, 60, 1, "CAS" )
  --        
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadron( "Maykop BAI", "BAI", { "CCCP KA-50 BAI" }, 10 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronBaiPatrol( "Maykop BAI", PatrolZone, 800, 900, 50, 80, 250, 300 )
  --        AIRDispatcher:SetSquadronPatrolInterval( "Maykop BAI", 2, 30, 60, 1, "BAI" )
  -- 
  -- 
  -- ### 3.5. Set squadron take-off methods
  -- 
  -- Use the various SetSquadronTakeoff... methods to control how squadrons are taking-off from the home airfield, FARP or ship.
  -- 
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoff}() is the generic configuration method to control takeoff from the air, hot, cold or from the runway. See the method for further details.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoffInAir}() will spawn new aircraft from the squadron directly in the air.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoffFromParkingCold}() will spawn new aircraft in without running engines at a parking spot at the airfield.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoffFromParkingHot}() will spawn new aircraft in with running engines at a parking spot at the airfield.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoffFromRunway}() will spawn new aircraft at the runway at the airfield.
  -- 
  -- **The default landing method is to spawn new aircraft directly in the air.**
  -- 
  -- Use these methods to fine-tune for specific airfields that are known to create bottlenecks, or have reduced airbase efficiency.
  -- The more and the longer aircraft need to taxi at an airfield, the more risk there is that:
  -- 
  --   * aircraft will stop waiting for each other or for a landing aircraft before takeoff.
  --   * aircraft may get into a "dead-lock" situation, where two aircraft are blocking each other.
  --   * aircraft may collide at the airbase.
  --   * aircraft may be awaiting the landing of a plane currently in the air, but never lands ...
  --   
  -- Currently within the DCS engine, the airfield traffic coordination is erroneous and contains a lot of bugs.
  -- If you experience while testing problems with aircraft take-off or landing, please use one of the above methods as a solution to workaround these issues!
  -- 
  -- This example sets the default takeoff method to be from the runway.
  -- And for a couple of squadrons overrides this default method.
  -- 
  --      -- Setup the Takeoff methods
  --      
  --      -- The default takeoff
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetDefaultTakeOffFromRunway()
  --      
  --      -- The individual takeoff per squadron
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronTakeoff( "Mineralnye", AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.Takeoff.Air )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronTakeoffInAir( "Sochi" )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronTakeoffFromRunway( "Mozdok" )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronTakeoffFromParkingCold( "Maykop" )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronTakeoffFromParkingHot( "Novo" )  
  -- 
  -- 
  -- ### 3.5.1. Set Squadron takeoff altitude when spawning new aircraft in the air.
  -- 
  -- In the case of the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoffInAir}() there is also an other parameter that can be applied.
  -- That is modifying or setting the **altitude** from where planes spawn in the air.
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoffInAirAltitude}() to set the altitude for a specific squadron.
  -- The default takeoff altitude can be modified or set using the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoffInAirAltitude}().
  -- As part of the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeoffInAir}() a parameter can be specified to set the takeoff altitude.
  -- If this parameter is not specified, then the default altitude will be used for the squadron.
  -- 
  -- ### 3.5.2. Set Squadron takeoff interval.
  -- 
  -- The different types of available airfields have different amounts of available launching platforms:
  -- 
  --   - Airbases typically have a lot of platforms.
  --   - FARPs have 4 platforms.
  --   - Ships have 2 to 4 platforms.
  --   
  -- Depending on the demand of requested takeoffs by the AIR dispatcher, an airfield can become overloaded. Too many aircraft need to be taken
  -- off at the same time, which will result in clutter as described above. In order to better control this behaviour, a takeoff scheduler is implemented,
  -- which can be used to control how many aircraft are ordered for takeoff between specific time intervals.
  -- The takeff intervals can be specified per squadron, which make sense, as each squadron have a "home" airfield.
  -- 
  -- For this purpose, the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronTakeOffInterval}() can be used to specify the takeoff intervals of 
  -- aircraft groups per squadron to avoid cluttering of aircraft at airbases.
  -- This is especially useful for FARPs and ships. Each takeoff dispatch is queued by the dispatcher and when the interval time
  -- has been reached, a new group will be spawned or activated for takeoff.
  -- 
  -- The interval needs to be estimated, and depends on the time needed for the aircraft group to actually depart from the launch platform, and
  -- the way how the aircraft are starting up. Cold starts take the longest duration, hot starts a few seconds, and runway takeoff also a few seconds for FARPs and ships.
  -- 
  -- See the underlying example:
  -- 
  --      -- Imagine a squadron launched from a FARP, with a grouping of 4.
  --      -- Aircraft will cold start from the FARP, and thus, a maximum of 4 aircraft can be launched at the same time.
  --      -- Additionally, depending on the group composition of the aircraft, defending units will be ordered for takeoff together.
  --      -- It takes about 3 to 4 minutes to takeoff helicopters from FARPs in cold start.
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronTakeOffInterval( "Mineralnye", 60 * 4 )
  -- 
  -- 
  -- ### 3.6. Set squadron landing methods
  -- 
  -- In analogy with takeoff, the landing methods are to control how squadrons land at the airfield:
  -- 
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronLanding}() is the generic configuration method to control landing, namely despawn the aircraft near the airfield in the air, right after landing, or at engine shutdown.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronLandingNearAirbase}() will despawn the returning aircraft in the air when near the airfield.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronLandingAtRunway}() will despawn the returning aircraft directly after landing at the runway.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronLandingAtEngineShutdown}() will despawn the returning aircraft when the aircraft has returned to its parking spot and has turned off its engines.
  -- 
  -- You can use these methods to minimize the airbase coordination overhead and to increase the airbase efficiency.
  -- When there are lots of aircraft returning for landing, at the same airbase, the takeoff process will be halted, which can cause a complete failure of the
  -- A2A defense system, as no new CAP or GCI planes can takeoff.
  -- Note that the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronLandingNearAirbase}() will only work for returning aircraft, not for damaged or out of fuel aircraft.
  -- Damaged or out-of-fuel aircraft are returning to the nearest friendly airbase and will land, and are out of control from ground control.
  -- 
  -- This example defines the default landing method to be at the runway.
  -- And for a couple of squadrons overrides this default method.
  -- 
  --      -- Setup the Landing methods
  -- 
  --      -- The default landing method
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetDefaultLandingAtRunway()
  -- 
  --      -- The individual landing per squadron
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronLandingAtRunway( "Mineralnye" )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronLandingNearAirbase( "Sochi" )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronLandingAtEngineShutdown( "Mozdok" )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronLandingNearAirbase( "Maykop" )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronLanding( "Novo", AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.Landing.AtRunway )
  -- 
  -- 
  -- ### 3.7. Set squadron **grouping**.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronGrouping}() to set the grouping of aircraft when spawned in.
  -- 
  -- ![Banner Image](..\Presentations\AI_AIR_DISPATCHER\Dia12.JPG)
  -- 
  -- In the case of **on call** engagement, the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronGrouping}() method has additional behaviour. 
  -- When there aren't enough patrol flights airborne, a on call will be initiated for the remaining
  -- targets to be engaged. Depending on the grouping parameter, the spawned flights for on call aircraft are grouped into this setting.   
  -- For example with a group setting of 2, if 3 targets are detected and cannot be engaged by the available patrols or any airborne flight, 
  -- an additional on call flight needs to be started.
  -- 
  -- The **grouping value is set for a Squadron**, and can be **dynamically adjusted** during mission execution, so to adjust the defense flights grouping when the tactical situation changes.
  -- 
  -- ### 3.8. Set the squadron **overhead** to balance the effectiveness of the AIR defenses.
  -- 
  -- The effectiveness can be set with the **overhead parameter**. This is a number that is used to calculate the amount of Units that dispatching command will allocate to GCI in surplus of detected amount of units.
  -- The **default value** of the overhead parameter is 1.0, which means **equal balance**.
  -- 
  -- ![Banner Image](..\Presentations\AI_AIR_DISPATCHER\Dia11.JPG)
  -- 
  -- However, depending on the (type of) aircraft (strength and payload) in the squadron and the amount of resources available, this parameter can be changed.
  -- 
  -- The @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronOverhead}() method can be used to tweak the defense strength,
  -- taking into account the plane types of the squadron. 
  -- 
  -- For example, a A-10C with full long-distance AIR missiles payload, may still be less effective than a Su-23 with short range AIR missiles...
  -- So in this case, one may want to use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetOverhead}() method to allocate more defending planes as the amount of detected attacking ground units.
  -- The overhead must be given as a decimal value with 1 as the neutral value, which means that overhead values: 
  -- 
  --   * Higher than 1.0, for example 1.5, will increase the defense unit amounts. For 4 attacking ground units detected, 6 aircraft will be spawned.
  --   * Lower than 1, for example 0.75, will decrease the defense unit amounts. For 4 attacking ground units detected, only 3 aircraft will be spawned.
  -- 
  -- The amount of defending units is calculated by multiplying the amount of detected attacking ground units as part of the detected group 
  -- multiplied by the overhead parameter, and rounded up to the smallest integer. 
  -- 
  -- Typically, for AIR defenses, values small than 1 will be used. Here are some good values for a couple of aircraft to support CAS operations:
  -- 
  --   - A-10C: 0.15
  --   - Su-34: 0.15
  --   - A-10A: 0.25
  --   - SU-25T: 0.10
  -- 
  -- So generically, the amount of missiles that an aircraft can take will determine its attacking effectiveness. The longer the range of the missiles, 
  -- the less risk that the defender may be destroyed by the enemy, thus, the less aircraft needs to be activated in a defense.
  -- 
  -- The **overhead value is set for a Squadron**, and can be **dynamically adjusted** during mission execution, so to adjust the defense overhead when the tactical situation changes.
  --
  -- ### 3.8. Set the squadron **engage limit**.
  -- 
  -- To limit the amount of aircraft to defend against a large group of intruders, an **engage limit** can be defined per squadron.
  -- This limit will avoid an extensive amount of aircraft to engage with the enemy if the attacking ground forces are enormous.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronEngageLimit}() to limit the amount of aircraft that will engage with the enemy, per squadron.
  --
  -- ## 4. Set the **fuel threshold**.
  -- 
  -- When aircraft get **out of fuel** to a certain %, which is by default **15% (0.15)**, there are two possible actions that can be taken:
  --  - The aircraft will go RTB, and will be replaced with a new aircraft if possible.
  --  - The aircraft will refuel at a tanker, if a tanker has been specified for the squadron.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronFuelThreshold}() to set the **squadron fuel threshold** of the aircraft for all squadrons.
  -- 
  -- ## 6. Other configuration options
  -- 
  -- ### 6.1. Set a tactical display panel.
  -- 
  -- Every 30 seconds, a tactical display panel can be shown that illustrates what the status is of the different groups controlled by AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetTacticalDisplay}() to switch on the tactical display panel. The default will not show this panel.
  -- Note that there may be some performance impact if this panel is shown.
  -- 
  -- ## 10. Default settings.
  -- 
  -- Default settings configure the standard behaviour of the squadrons. 
  -- This section a good overview of the different parameters that setup the behaviour of **ALL** the squadrons by default.
  -- Note that default behaviour can be tweaked, and thus, this will change the behaviour of all the squadrons.
  -- Unless there is a specific behaviour set for a specific squadron, the default configured behaviour will be followed.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.1. Default **takeoff** behaviour.
  -- 
  -- The default takeoff behaviour is set to **in the air**, which means that new spawned aircraft will be spawned directly in the air above the airbase by default.
  -- 
  -- **The default takeoff method can be set for ALL squadrons that don't have an individual takeoff method configured.**
  -- 
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultTakeoff}() is the generic configuration method to control takeoff by default from the air, hot, cold or from the runway. See the method for further details.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultTakeoffInAir}() will spawn by default new aircraft from the squadron directly in the air.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultTakeoffFromParkingCold}() will spawn by default new aircraft in without running engines at a parking spot at the airfield.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultTakeoffFromParkingHot}() will spawn by default new aircraft in with running engines at a parking spot at the airfield.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultTakeoffFromRunway}() will spawn by default new aircraft at the runway at the airfield.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.2. Default landing behaviour.
  -- 
  -- The default landing behaviour is set to **near the airbase**, which means that returning airplanes will be despawned directly in the air by default.
  -- 
  -- The default landing method can be set for ALL squadrons that don't have an individual landing method configured.
  -- 
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultLanding}() is the generic configuration method to control by default landing, namely despawn the aircraft near the airfield in the air, right after landing, or at engine shutdown.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultLandingNearAirbase}() will despawn by default the returning aircraft in the air when near the airfield.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultLandingAtRunway}() will despawn by default the returning aircraft directly after landing at the runway.
  --   * @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultLandingAtEngineShutdown}() will despawn by default the returning aircraft when the aircraft has returned to its parking spot and has turned off its engines.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.3. Default **overhead**.
  -- 
  -- The default overhead is set to **0.25**. That essentially means that for each 4 ground enemies there will be 1 aircraft dispatched.
  -- 
  -- The default overhead value can be set for ALL squadrons that don't have an individual overhead value configured.
  --
  -- Use the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultOverhead}() method can be used to set the default overhead or defense strength for ALL squadrons.
  --
  -- ## 10.4. Default **grouping**.
  -- 
  -- The default grouping is set to **one airplane**. That essentially means that there won't be any grouping applied by default.
  -- 
  -- The default grouping value can be set for ALL squadrons that don't have an individual grouping value configured.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultGrouping}() to set the **default grouping** of spawned airplanes for all squadrons.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.5. Default RTB fuel threshold.
  -- 
  -- When an airplane gets **out of fuel** to a certain %, which is **15% (0.15)**, it will go RTB, and will be replaced with a new airplane when applicable.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultFuelThreshold}() to set the **default fuel threshold** of spawned airplanes for all squadrons.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.6. Default RTB damage threshold.
  -- 
  -- When an airplane is **damaged** to a certain %, which is **40% (0.40)**, it will go RTB, and will be replaced with a new airplane when applicable.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultDamageThreshold}() to set the **default damage threshold** of spawned airplanes for all squadrons.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.7. Default settings for **patrol**.
  -- 
  -- ### 10.7.1. Default **patrol time Interval**.
  -- 
  -- Patrol dispatching is time event driven, and will evaluate in random time intervals if a new patrol needs to be dispatched.
  -- 
  -- The default patrol time interval is between **180** and **600** seconds.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultPatrolTimeInterval}() to set the **default patrol time interval** of dispatched aircraft for ALL squadrons.
  --   
  -- Note that you can still change the patrol limit and patrol time intervals for each patrol individually using 
  -- the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronPatrolTimeInterval}() method.
  -- 
  -- ### 10.7.2. Default **patrol limit**.
  -- 
  -- Multiple patrol can be airborne at the same time for one squadron, which is controlled by the **patrol limit**.
  -- The **default patrol limit** is 1 patrol per squadron to be airborne at the same time.
  -- Note that the default patrol limit is used when a squadron patrol is defined, and cannot be changed afterwards.
  -- So, ensure that you set the default patrol limit **before** you define or setup the squadron patrol.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultPatrolTimeInterval}() to set the **default patrol time interval** of dispatched aircraft patrols for all squadrons.  
  -- Note that you can still change the patrol limit and patrol time intervals for each patrol individually using 
  -- the @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetSquadronPatrolTimeInterval}() method.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.7.3. Default tanker for refuelling when executing CAP.
  -- 
  -- Instead of sending CAP to RTB when out of fuel, you can let CAP refuel in mid air using a tanker.
  -- This greatly increases the efficiency of your CAP operations.
  -- 
  -- In the mission editor, setup a group with task Refuelling. A tanker unit of the correct coalition will be automatically selected.
  -- Then, use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultTanker}() to set the tanker for the dispatcher.
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDefaultFuelThreshold}() to set the % left in the defender airplane tanks when a refuel action is needed.
  -- 
  -- When the tanker specified is alive and in the air, the tanker will be used for refuelling.
  -- 
  -- For example, the following setup will set the default refuel tanker to "Tanker":
  -- 
  -- ![Banner Image](..\Presentations\AI_AIR_DISPATCHER\AI_AIR_DISPATCHER-ME_11.JPG)
  -- 
  --      -- Define the CAP
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadron( "Sochi", AIRBASE.Caucasus.Sochi_Adler, { "SQ CCCP SU-34" }, 20 )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronCap( "Sochi", ZONE:New( "PatrolZone" ), 4000, 8000, 600, 800, 1000, 1300 )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronCapInterval("Sochi", 2, 30, 600, 1 ) 
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetSquadronGci( "Sochi", 900, 1200 )
  --      
  --      -- Set the default tanker for refuelling to "Tanker", when the default fuel threshold has reached 90% fuel left.
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetDefaultFuelThreshold( 0.9 )
  --      A2ADispatcher:SetDefaultTanker( "Tanker" )
  --  
  -- ## 10.8. Default settings for GCI.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.8.1. Optimal intercept point calculation.
  -- 
  -- When intruders are detected, the intrusion path of the attackers can be monitored by the EWR.  
  -- Although defender planes might be on standby at the airbase, it can still take some time to get the defenses up in the air if there aren't any defenses airborne.
  -- This time can easily take 2 to 3 minutes, and even then the defenders still need to fly towards the target, which takes also time.
  -- 
  -- Therefore, an optimal **intercept point** is calculated which takes a couple of parameters:
  -- 
  --   * The average bearing of the intruders for an amount of seconds.
  --   * The average speed of the intruders for an amount of seconds.
  --   * An assumed time it takes to get planes operational at the airbase.
  -- 
  -- The **intercept point** will determine:
  -- 
  --   * If there are any friendlies close to engage the target. These can be defenders performing CAP or defenders in RTB.
  --   * The optimal airbase from where defenders will takeoff for GCI.
  -- 
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetIntercept}() to modify the assumed intercept delay time to calculate a valid interception.
  -- 
  -- ## 10.8.2. Default Disengage Radius.
  -- 
  -- The radius to **disengage any target** when the **distance** of the defender to the **home base** is larger than the specified meters.
  -- The default Disengage Radius is **300km** (300000 meters). Note that the Disengage Radius is applicable to ALL squadrons!
  --   
  -- Use the method @{#AI_AIR_DISPATCHER.SetDisengageRadius}() to modify the default Disengage Radius to another distance setting.
  -- 
  -- ## 11. Airbase capture:
  -- 
  -- Different squadrons can be located at one airbase.
  -- If the airbase gets captured, that is, when there is an enemy unit near the airbase, and there aren't anymore friendlies at the airbase, the airbase will change coalition ownership.
