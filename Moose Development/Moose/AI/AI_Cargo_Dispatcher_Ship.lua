--- **AI** - Models the intelligent transportation of infantry and other cargo using Ships.
--
-- ## Features:
-- 
--   * Transport cargo to various deploy zones using naval vehicles.
--   * Various @{Cargo.Cargo#CARGO} types can be transported, including infantry, vehicles, and crates.
--   * Define a deploy zone of various types to determine the destination of the cargo.
--   * Ships will follow shipping lanes as defined in the Mission Editor.
--   * Multiple ships can transport multiple cargo as a single group.

--- @type AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP
-- @extends AI.AI_Cargo_Dispatcher#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER


--- A dynamic cargo transportation capability for AI groups.
-- 
-- Naval vessels can be mobilized to semi-intelligently transport cargo within the simulation.
--
-- The AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP module is derived from the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER module.
--
-- ## Note! In order to fully understand the mechanisms of the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP class, it is recommended that you first consult and READ the documentation of the @{AI.AI_Cargo_Dispatcher} module!!!
--
-- This will be particularly helpful in order to determine how to **Tailor the different cargo handling events**.
--
-- The AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP class uses the @{Cargo.Cargo} capabilities within the MOOSE framework.
-- Also ensure that you fully understand how to declare and setup Cargo objects within the MOOSE framework before using this class.
-- CARGO derived objects must generally be declared within the mission to make the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP object recognize the cargo.
--
--
-- # 1) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP constructor.
-- 
--   * @{#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP.New}(): Creates a new AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP object.
--
-- ---
--
-- # 2) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP is a Finite State Machine.
--
-- This section must be read as follows... Each of the rows indicate a state transition, triggered through an event, and with an ending state of the event was executed.
-- The first column is the **From** state, the second column the **Event**, and the third column the **To** state.
--
-- So, each of the rows have the following structure.
--
--   * **From** => **Event** => **To**
--
-- Important to know is that an event can only be executed if the **current state** is the **From** state.
-- This, when an **Event** that is being triggered has a **From** state that is equal to the **Current** state of the state machine, the event will be executed,
-- and the resulting state will be the **To** state.
--
-- These are the different possible state transitions of this state machine implementation:
-- 
--   * Idle => Start => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Monitor => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Stop => Idle
--      
--   * Monitoring => Pickup => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Load => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Loading => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Loaded => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => PickedUp => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Deploy => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Unload => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Unloaded => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Deployed => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Home => Monitoring
-- 
--      
-- ## 2.1) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER States.
-- 
--   * **Monitoring**: The process is dispatching.
--   * **Idle**: The process is idle.
-- 
-- ## 2.2) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER Events.
-- 
--   * **Start**: Start the transport process.
--   * **Stop**: Stop the transport process.
--   * **Monitor**: Monitor and take action.
--   
--   * **Pickup**: Pickup cargo.
--   * **Load**: Load the cargo.
--   * **Loading**: The dispatcher is coordinating the loading of a cargo.
--   * **Loaded**: Flag that the cargo is loaded.
--   * **PickedUp**: The dispatcher has loaded all requested cargo into the CarrierGroup.
--   * **Deploy**: Deploy cargo to a location.
--   * **Unload**: Unload the cargo.
--   * **Unloaded**: Flag that the cargo is unloaded.
--   * **Deployed**: All cargo is unloaded from the carriers in the group.
--   * **Home**: A Carrier is going home.
-- 
-- ## 2.3) Enhance your mission scripts with **Tailored** Event Handling!
-- 
-- Within your mission, you can capture these events when triggered, and tailor the events with your own code!
-- Check out the @{AI.AI_Cargo_Dispatcher#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER} class at chapter 3 for details on the different event handlers that are available and how to use them.
-- 
-- **There are a lot of templates available that allows you to quickly setup an event handler for a specific event type!**
--

-- 
-- # 3) Set the pickup parameters.
-- 
-- Several parameters can be set to pickup cargo:
-- 
--    * @{#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP.SetPickupRadius}(): Sets or randomizes the pickup location for the Ship around the cargo coordinate in a radius defined an outer and optional inner radius. 
--    * @{#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP.SetPickupSpeed}(): Set the speed or randomizes the speed in km/h to pickup the cargo.
--    
-- # 4) Set the deploy parameters.
-- 
-- Several parameters can be set to deploy cargo:
-- 
--    * @{#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP.SetDeployRadius}(): Sets or randomizes the deploy location for the Ship around the cargo coordinate in a radius defined an outer and an optional inner radius. 
--    * @{#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP.SetDeploySpeed}(): Set the speed or randomizes the speed in km/h to deploy the cargo.
-- 
-- # 5) Set the home zone when there isn't any more cargo to pickup.
-- 
-- A home zone can be specified to where the Ship will move when there isn't any cargo left for pickup.
-- Use @{#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_SHIP.SetHomeZone}() to specify the home zone.
-- 
-- If no home zone is specified, the Ship will wait near the deploy zone for a new pickup command.   
--
-- # Developer Note
-- 
-- Note while this class still works, it is no longer supported as the original author stopped active development of MOOSE
-- Therefore, this class is considered to be deprecated
