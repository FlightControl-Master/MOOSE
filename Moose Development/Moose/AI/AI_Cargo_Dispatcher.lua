-- 
-- # The dispatcher concept.
-- 
-- Carrier equipment can be mobilized to intelligently transport infantry and other cargo within the simulation.
-- The AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER module uses the @{Cargo.Cargo} capabilities within the MOOSE framework, to enable Carrier GROUP objects 
-- to transport @{Cargo.Cargo} towards several deploy zones.
-- @{Cargo.Cargo} must be declared within the mission to make the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER object recognize the cargo.
-- Please consult the @{Cargo.Cargo} module for more information. 
-- 
-- 
-- ## Why cargo dispatching?
-- 
-- It provides a realistic way of distributing your army forces around the battlefield, and to provide a quick means of cargo transportation.
-- Instead of having troops or cargo to "appear" suddenly at certain locations, the dispatchers will pickup the cargo and transport it.
-- It also allows to enforce or retreat your army from certain zones when needed, using helicopters or APCs.
-- Airplanes can transport cargo over larger distances between the airfields.
-- 
-- 
-- ## What is a cargo object then?
-- 
-- In order to make use of the MOOSE cargo system, you need to **declare** the DCS objects as MOOSE cargo objects!
-- This sounds complicated, but it is actually quite simple.
-- 
-- See here an example:
-- 
--     local EngineerCargoGroup = CARGO_GROUP:New( GROUP:FindByName( "Engineers" ), "Workmaterials", "Engineers", 250 )
--     
-- The above code declares a MOOSE cargo object called `EngineerCargoGroup`.
-- It actually just refers to an infantry group created within the sim called `"Engineers"`.
-- The infantry group now becomes controlled by the MOOSE cargo object `EngineerCargoGroup`.
-- A MOOSE cargo object also has properties, like the type of cargo, the logical name, and the reporting range.
-- 
-- For more information, please consult the @{Cargo.Cargo} module documentation. Please read through it, because it will explain how to setup the cargo objects for use
-- within your dispatchers.
-- 
-- 
-- ## Do I need to do a lot of coding to setup a dispatcher?
-- 
-- No! It requires a bit of studying to set it up, but once you understand the different components that use the cargo dispatcher, it becomes very easy.
-- Also, the dispatchers work in a true dynamic environment. The carriers and cargo, pickup and deploy zones can be created dynamically in your mission,
-- and will automatically be recognized by the dispatcher.
-- 
-- 
-- ## Is the dispatcher causing a lot of CPU overhead?
-- 
-- A little yes, but once the cargo is properly loaded into the carrier, the CPU consumption is very little.
-- When infantry or vehicles board into a carrier, or unboard from a carrier, you may perceive certain performance lags.
-- We are working to minimize the impact of those.
-- That being said, the DCS simulator is limited. It is just impossible to deploy hundreds of cargo over the battlefield, hundreds of helicopters transporting, 
-- without any performance impact. The amount of helicopters that are active and flying in your simulation influences more the performance than the dispatchers.
-- It really comes down to trying it out and getting experienced with what is possible and what is not (or too much).
-- 
-- 
-- ## Are the dispatchers a "black box" in terms of the logic?
-- 
-- No. You can tailor the dispatcher mechanisms using event handlers, and create additional logic to enhance the behaviour and dynamism in your own mission.
-- The events are listed below, and so are the options, but here are a couple of examples of what is possible:
-- 
--    * You could handle the **Deployed** event, when all the cargo is unloaded from a carrier in the dispatcher.
--      Adding your own code to the event handler, you could move the deployed cargo (infantry) to specific points to engage in the battlefield.
--    
--    * When a carrier is picking up cargo, the *Pickup** event is triggered, and you can inform the coalition of this event, 
--      because it is an indication that troops are planned to join.
-- 
--    
-- ## Are there options that you can set to modify the behaviour of the carries?
-- 
-- Yes, there are options to configure:
-- 
--    * the location where carriers will park or land near the cargo for pickup. 
--    * the location where carriers will park or land in the deploy zone for cargo deployment.
--    * the height for airborne carriers when they fly to and from pickup and deploy zones.
--    * the speed of the carriers. This is an important parameter, because depending on the tactication situation, speed will influence the detection by radars.
-- 
-- 
-- ## Can the zones be of any zone type?
-- 
-- Yes, please ensure that the zones are declared using the @{Core.Zone} classes.
-- Possible zones that function at the moment are ZONE, ZONE_GROUP, ZONE_UNIT, ZONE_POLYGON.

-- # 2) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER is a Finite State Machine.
-- 
-- This section must be read as follows. Each of the rows indicate a state transition, triggered through an event, and with an ending state of the event was executed.
-- The first column is the **From** state, the second column the **Event**, and the third column the **To** state.
-- 
-- So, each of the rows have the following structure.
-- 
--   * **From** => **Event** => **To**
-- 
-- Important to know is that an event can only be executed if the **current state** is the **From** state.
-- This, when an **Event** that is being triggered has a **From** state that is equal to the **Current** state of the state machine, the event will be executed,
-- and the resulting state will be the **To** state.
-- 
-- These are the different possible state transitions of this state machine implementation: 
-- 
--   * Idle => Start => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Monitor => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Stop => Idle
--      
--   * Monitoring => Pickup => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Load => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Loading => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Loaded => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => PickedUp => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Deploy => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Unload => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Unloaded => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Deployed => Monitoring
--   * Monitoring => Home => Monitoring
--
-- ## 2.1) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER States.
-- 
--   * **Monitoring**: The process is dispatching.
--   * **Idle**: The process is idle.
-- 
-- ## 2.2) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER Events.
-- 
--   * **Start**: Start the transport process.
--   * **Stop**: Stop the transport process.
--   * **Monitor**: Monitor and take action.
--   
--   * **Pickup**: Pickup cargo.
--   * **Load**: Load the cargo.
--   * **Loading**: The dispatcher is coordinating the loading of a cargo.
--   * **Loaded**: Flag that the cargo is loaded.
--   * **PickedUp**: The dispatcher has loaded all requested cargo into the CarrierGroup.
--   * **Deploy**: Deploy cargo to a location.
--   * **Unload**: Unload the cargo.
--   * **Unloaded**: Flag that the cargo is unloaded.
--   * **Deployed**: All cargo is unloaded from the carriers in the group.
--   * **Home**: A Carrier is going home.

-- 
-- # 3) Enhance your mission scripts with **Tailored** Event Handling!
-- 
-- Use these methods to capture the events and tailor the events with your own code!
-- All classes derived from AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER can capture these events, and you can write your own code.
-- 
-- In order to properly capture the events, it is mandatory that you execute the following actions using your script:
-- 
--   * Copy / Paste the code section into your script.
--   * Change the CLASS literal to the object name you have in your script.
--   * Within the function, you can now write your own code!
--   * IntelliSense will recognize the type of the variables provided by the function. Note: the From, Event and To variables can be safely ignored, 
--     but you need to declare them as they are automatically provided by the event handling system of MOOSE.
-- 
-- You can send messages or fire off any other events within the code section. The sky is the limit!
-- 
-- Mission AID-CGO-140, AID-CGO-240 and AID-CGO-340 contain examples how these events can be tailored.
-- 
-- For those who don't have the time to check the test missions, find the underlying example of a Deployed event that is tailored.
-- 
--      --- Deployed Handler OnAfter for AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER.
--      -- Use this event handler to tailor the event when a carrier has deployed all cargo objects from the CarrierGroup.
