--- Message System to display Messages for Clients and Coalitions or All.
-- Messages are grouped on the display panel per Category to improve readability for the players.
-- Messages are shown on the display panel for an amount of seconds, and will then disappear.
-- Messages are identified by an ID. The messages with the same ID belonging to the same category will be overwritten if they were still being displayed on the display panel.
-- Messages are created with MESSAGE:@{New}().
-- Messages are sent to Clients with MESSAGE:@{ToClient}().
-- Messages are sent to Coalitions with MESSAGE:@{ToCoalition}().
-- Messages are sent to All Players with MESSAGE:@{ToAll}().
