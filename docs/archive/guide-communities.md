# Communities

MOOSE is broadcasted, documented and supported through various social media channels.

## 1. MOOSE on YouTube

MOOSE has a [broadcast channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjrA9j5LQoWsG4SpS8i79Qg) on youtube.
These videos are grouped into playlists, which explain specific MOOSE capabilities,
and gradually build up the "understanding" and "what is possible" to do with the MOOSE framework.
I really, really encourage all to watch the explanation videos.

Some mandatory videos to watch are:

  * [MOOSE Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ZUrU4zZUl1JEtVcyf9sazUV5_fGICz4)
  * [MOOSE Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hxae3mTCE8&t=159s&index=1&list=PL7ZUrU4zZUl0riB9ULVh-bZvFlw1_Wym2)
  * [MOOSE Spawning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ZUrU4zZUl1jirWIo4t4YxqN-HxjqRkL)
  * [MOOSE Tasking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ZUrU4zZUl3CgxN2iAViiGLTPpQ-Ajdg)
  * [MOOSE Task Dispatching](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ZUrU4zZUl3I6ieFM-cjey-rncF1ktNI)

## 2. MOOSE on Eagle Dynamics forums

This is a default thread at the Eagle Dynamics forums where the MOOSE framework can be discussed and supported.
The thread is called [MOOSE - Mission Object Oriented Scripting Framework].

## 3. MOOSE development on GitHub

I encourage that you create also a user at [GitHub](https://github.com/FlightControl-Master/MOOSE).
On the GitHub site, you can register issues, feedback and comments in the issues section of the site.
This allows to track this feedback and issues, in order to provide a structured support and create a milestone plan.
In other words, treat this development as a project.

## 4. MOOSE community on Discord

Join our MOOSE community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gj68fm969S).
A place where mission designers and developers come together to discuss the latest features.
We are now with about 5 people supporting Mission Designers on Discord.

There are currently more than 300 members on our discord MOOSE channel.
