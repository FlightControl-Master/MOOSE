# Build GitHub Pages

This documentation is created by [GitHub Pages]. The source files are
stored in the repository [MOOSE] in the subfolder `docs`.
We use [Just the Docs], which is a modern, highly customizable, and responsive
[Jekyll] theme for documentation.

{: .note }
> The class documentation is created by its own [build] and is not the scope for this page!

The build steps to create this documentation are defined in [.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml].

It is divided into two jobs:
- build:
    - Only changes to in the subfolder `docs` or `gh-pages.yml` will trigger a build.
    - Checkout of the git repository [MOOSE].
    - Setup [Ruby] version 3.1, which is needed by [Jekyll].
    - Run action [configure-pages].
    - Build with [Jekyll].
    - Run action [upload-pages-artifact].
- deploy:
    - Run action [deploy-pages].

# Preview of this documentation

When enhancing this documentation it is very useful to see a 1on1 preview of the pages.
This can be displayed as follows:

- You need a working installation of [Docker].
- Go to the `docs` subfolder.
- Run `docker compose up`.
- Open a browser with the following URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.
- After a change of the [Markdown] files, wait some seconds and press F5 in the browser.

{: .warning }
> Some changes are not processed properly with this procedure. It is then
> necessary to stop and restart the container once. On startup everything is
> always regenerated.
