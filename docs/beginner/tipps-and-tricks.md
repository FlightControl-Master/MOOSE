## Find the Saved Games folder

DCS creates a folder to store all user specific configuration and data.
This folder can be found in your userprofile as subfolder of `Saved Games`.

The easiest way to find it, is to open search and paste the text below into it
and press Enter:

```%userprofile%\Saved Games```

{: .note }
> The text will work even if your Windows is installed with another language,
> e.g. German. This is really usefull.

Depending on the DCS version you will find one of the following folders:

- DCS
- DCS.openbeta

{: .note }
> It is good idea to add the folder to the quick access area in the windows
> explorer. You will use it very often!

For MOOSE users the folders `Missions`, `Logs` and `Config` are most important!
